# CodepathWeek9
HoneyPot assignment

# Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:
* I deployed the Dionaea with HTTP Honeypot

# Any issues you encountered
* The wrong github link, then i had to start over and wipe my original vm.  Then I could only access the map and not the dashboard.  
So another reinstall and everything was fine.


# A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.
* Number of attacks after about 15 hrs: ~6,800
* Top Ports:
  1. 8088 (1,320 times)
  2. 80 (267 times)
  3. 23 (150 times)
  4. 8080 (81 times)
  5. 445 (68 times)

# Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected:
* A majority of the attacks came from the US.  Not from russia as I would have suspected.
* Only a single attack came from Africa, I am not sure as of why.
* Zero attacks from New Zealand, they seem like nice people.
